## Submissions and Appeals

Our tracker protection lists are dynamic and we welcome and rely on feedback from our community. If you believe that weâ€™ve missed a tracker, or categorized a domain incorrectly you can submit a new one by one of these methods:

- Filling out our [tracker protection form](https://disconnect.me/trackerprotection)
- Opening a new [issue](https://github.com/disconnectme/github_testbed/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=submissions_and_appeals.yml) on this repo and submitting the necesary information.
